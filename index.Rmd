# Intro {-}

Text mining identifies patterns in text. Text mining is commonly used for topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and classification modeling. There are two main approaches to text mining.  *Semantic parsing* identifies words by type and order (sentences, phrases, nouns/verbs, proper nouns, etc.).  *Bag of words* simply treats words as attributes of the document.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
